Hi, I have made this mod from the code base of another cereator, huge credit to: Space Maze 

Here's the message from the previous creator explaining how this mod works: 

"Hi, if you're reading this, then most likely you're interested in how this mod works.
In fact, everything is simple. An unused, separate equipment with the name and design of manpower has been added. 
When it is produced and accumulated in the warehouse, a hidden trigger occurs every week, 
which takes away all the manpower produced in the warehouse and adds this number to the current manpower of the country. 
Using this technology, you can make the production of anything: stability, political power, research cells, military experience, and so on.
 If you do something similar using my technology, you can use it with credit XD

Have fun!"


 Feels free to make another mod based on my current mod, just make sure to credit me XD
